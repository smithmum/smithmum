- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @smithmum
- ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in public administration, specifically in utilizing data science to help automate methods of evidence collection related to evaluating public policy to support better decision-making by elected officials.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning python's data science capabilities, having spent the last decade working with R. Also, I am working on a doctoral dissertation, which is to say that I am learning tons of obscure public administration ontologies and applied practice.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me? Easiest is via email: kirkbsmith [at] gmail [dot] com.
